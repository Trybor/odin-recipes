This repository contains the code for the Odin Recipes assignment. The goal of this project is to create a simple recipe website with multiple recipe pages.

Here is a preview: https://64c24a6cfb59f0033faf984c--vocal-souffle-baafd2.netlify.app/

Iteration 1: Initial Structure
Created the index.html file with basic HTML boilerplate.
Added an h1 heading "Odin Recipes" to the body.

Iteration 2: Recipe Page
Created a new directory named recipes within the odin-recipes directory.
Added a new HTML file within the recipes directory for a specific recipe (e.g., lasagna.html).
Included an h1 heading with the recipe's name as its content in the recipe page.

Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
The recipe page contains the following content:
An image of the finished dish.
A "Description" heading with a paragraph describing the recipe.
An "Ingredients" heading with an unordered list of the required ingredients.
A "Steps" heading with an ordered list of the steps to make the dish.

Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
Added two more recipe pages with the same structure as the initial recipe page.
Linked to the new recipes on the index.html page, organizing them in an unordered list.
Feel free to explore the different recipe pages to find delicious dishes to try!

Note: The images used in the recipes can be found on Google or from the recipe site provided in the assignment.

Happy cooking! üç≥üçΩÔ∏è
