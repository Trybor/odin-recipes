            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Step</b>
                    <p>Place 1 pork chop between 2 sheets of plastic wrap on a clean work surface or cutting board.
                        Pound pork chop using a meat mallet until 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to a clean plate. Repeat with
                        remaining pork chops. Evenly sprinkle pork chops with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon
                        black pepper.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Step</b>
                    <p>Mix together flour, garlic powder, onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon
                        pepper in a shallow dish. Place eggs and milk in a separate shallow dish and whisk to combine.
                        Place breadcrumbs in a separate shallow dish. Dip a pork chop in flour, dusting off excess
                        flour; dip in egg mixture, allowing excess to drip off. Place into breadcrumbs; flip and press
                        pork into breadcrumbs until well covered. Repeat with remaining pork chops. Place prepared pork
                        chops on a plate or sheet tray and transfer to the refrigerator, uncovered, for 5 to 10 minutes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Step</b>
                    <p>Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high.
                        Add 2 pork chops and cook, flipping once, until golden brown on each side and no longer pink in
                        the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
                        read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Adjust heat to prevent burning.</p>

                        butter and repeat with remaining 2 pork chops. Sprinkle cooked pork chops with remaining 1/4
                        teaspoon salt and thyme. Serve chops with lemon wedges.</p>
